# ðŸ’¾ ir-datasets-longeval

Extension for accessing the [LongEval](https://clef-longeval.github.io/) datasets via [ir_datasets](https://ir-datasets.com/).

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```shell
pip install ir-datasets-longeval
```

## Usage

Using this extension is simple. Just register the additional datasets by calling `register()`. Then you can load the datasets with [ir_datasets](https://ir-datasets.com/python.html) as usual:

```python
from ir_datasets import load
from ir_datasets_longeval import register

# Register the longeval datasets.
register()
# Use ir_datasets as usual.
dataset = load("longeval-web/2022-06")
```

You can also register only the `longeval-web` or `longeval-sci` dataset:

```Python
from ir_datasets import load
from ir_datasets_longeval import register

# Register the longeval datasets.
register("longeval-web")
```


If you want to use the [CLI](https://ir-datasets.com/cli.html), just use the `ir_datasets_longeval` instead of `ir_datasets`. All CLI commands will work as usual, e.g., to list the available datasets:

```shell
ir_datasets_longeval list
```

## Development

To build this package and contribute to its development you need to install the `build`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` packages (pre-installed on most systems):

```shell
pip install build setuptools wheel
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```shell
python3.10 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies

Install the package and test dependencies:

```shell
pip install -e .[tests]
```

### Testing

Verify your changes against the test suite to verify.

```shell
ruff check .                   # Code format and LINT
mypy .                         # Static typing
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .  # Security
pytest .                       # Unit tests
```

Please also add tests for your newly developed code.

### Build wheels

Wheels for this package can be built with:

```shell
python -m build
```
